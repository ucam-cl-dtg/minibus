TODO
====

* Use the omnibus API rather than the old Deprecated API
* The map doesn't cope well with zooming in and out in terms of what stops it shows and so it isn't possible to tell whether there are stops at a location from a distance.
* Redraw map after installing definitions so that the flags appear
